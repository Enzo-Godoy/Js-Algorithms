function Animal() { }
function Bird() { }
function Dog() { }

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);


Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();


Add method after inheritances
a constructor function that inherits its prototype object from a supertype constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods. 

Example 
Bird as a constructor that inherits its proptotype from Animal . 

function Animal () { } 
Animal.prototype.eat = function () { 
  console.log ("nom nom nom "); 
}; 
function Bird () { 
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird; 
}

In addition to what is inherited from Animal, we want to add behavior that is unique to Bird objects. 

Example with fly function 

Bird.prototype.fly = function() { 
  console.log.("i'm flying!");
}; 

Now instances of Bird will have both eat() and fly() methods. 

let duck = new Bird(); 
duck.eat();   //prints "nom nom nom"
duck.fly(); //prints "I'm flying!"
