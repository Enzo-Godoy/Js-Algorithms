Arrow functions to write concise anonymous functions. 
In js, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a functions as an argument to another function. instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to name these functions beacuse we do not reuse them anywhere else. 

Example : 
const myFunc = function () { 
    const myVar = "value";
    return myVar;
}


----------- ES6 (Arrow function) ------------

const myFunc = ()   =>  {
  const myVar = "value"; 
  return myVar;
}


---------------------------------------------

When there is no function body, and only a return value, arrow function syntax allos us to omit the keyword return as well as the brackets surrounding the code. This helps simplify smaller functions into  one-line statements  : 

const myFunc = ()  => "value" 

//This code will still return 'value' by default.
